\par There could be 3 types of cell in the terms of birth-death pairs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Births} - The cells which are births of some cycles
    \item \textbf{Deaths} - The cells which are deaths of some cycles
    \item \textbf{Unpaired} - The cells which are not birth or deaths of any cycle
\end{itemize}

\par So we have defined 5 types of transpositions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Birth-Birth} - The switch transpositions of 2 brith cells
    \item \textbf{Birth-Death} - The switch transpositions of brith and death cells
    \item \textbf{Death-Death} - The switch transpositions of 2 death cells
    \item \textbf{Undefined} - The transpositions where at least 1 cell is unpaired
    \item \textbf{No switch} - No switch transposition, where all cells are paired
\end{itemize}

\par In the Figure \ref{fig:switch-full} we can see the mean count of transpositions of each type for barycentric cubical tori of different dimensions $d$ and size $n$.
We can see that no switch transpositions are majority of cases. So we also can look at Figure \ref{fig:switch-without-noswitch} to get how other types are distributed.
