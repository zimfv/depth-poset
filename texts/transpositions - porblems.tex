\par Write $\text{Succ}(s, t) = \text{Succ}'(s, t) = \text{Succ}''(s, t)$ for the succesors and $\text{Pred}(s, t) = \text{Pred}'(s, t) = \text{Pred}''(s, t)$ for the predecessors (ancessors) of the pair in $D$, $D'$, $D''$, respectively.

\par Since $D = D' \cup D''$, we also have $\text{Succ}(s, t) = \text{Succ}'(s, t) \cup \text{Succ}''(s, t)$ and $\text{Pred}(s, t) = \text{Pred}'(s, t) \cup \text{Pred}''(s, t)$.

\subsection{Lemma 3.1.}
\par Suppose $(x, y)$ and $(a, b)$ are birth-death pairs of $f: X\to R$, $a, x$ are consecutive in the ordering of the cellls by $f$, and the transposition $a, x$ is a switch. Then
$$
\text{Succ}'(a, y) = \{(x, b)\} \cup \text{Succ}'(a, b) \cup \{(s, t)\in \text{Succ}'(x, y) | f(t)<f(b)\}
$$
$$
%\text{Succ}'(x, b) = \{(s, t)\in \text{Succ}'(x, y) \oplus \text{Succ}'(a, b) | f(t) > f(b)\}
\text{Succ}'(x, b) = \{(s, t)\in \text{Succ}'(x, y) \cup \text{Succ}'(a, b) | f(t) > f(b)\}
$$

\subsection{Lemma 3.2.}
\par Suppose $(a, b)$ and $(x, y)$ are birth-death pairs of $f:X\to R$, $y, b$ are consecutive in the ordering by $f$, and transposition of $y, b$ is a switch. Then
$$
\text{Succ}''(x, b) = \{(a, y)\} \cup \text{Succ}''(a, b) \cup \{(s, t)\in \text{Succ}''(x, y) | f(a) < f(s)\}
$$
$$
%\text{Succ}''(a, y) = \{(s, t)\in \text{Succ}''(a, b) \oplus \text{Succ}''(x, y) | f(s) < f(a)\}
\text{Succ}''(a, y) = \{(s, t)\in \text{Succ}''(a, b) \cup \text{Succ}''(x, y) | f(s) < f(a)\}
$$

\subsection{Lemma 3.3.}
\par Suppose $(a, b)$ and $(x, y)$ are birth-death pairs of $f$: $X\to R$, $b, x$ are consecutive in the ordering by $f$, and the transposition of $b, x$ is a switch. Then
$$
\text{Succ}(a, x) = \text{Succ}(a, b)
\;\;\text{and}\;\; 
\text{Succ}(b, y) = \text{Succ}(x, y)
$$

\subsection{Hypothesis 1}
\par Suppose $a$ and $b$ are 2-simplices consecutive in the ordering by $f$. And there is another Morse function $f^*$: 
$$
f^*(s) = 
\begin{cases}
f(s), \; \text{if} \; s\ne a, b \\
f(b), \; \text{if} \; s = a \\
f(a), \; \text{if} \; s = b
\end{cases}
$$
Let's denote $DP_{f}^\text{min}$ the transitive reduction of the Depth Poset defined by the filtration $f$. And let's deonote $DP_{f}^\text{min}(s)$ the set of nodes in $DP_f(s)$ which are pairs containing cell $s$ and the set of edges with these nodes.

\par \textbf{Hypothesis:} if the cell $s$ has no faces and cofaces with $a$ and $b$, then $DP_f^\text{min}(s) = DP_{f^*}^\text{min}(s)$.
