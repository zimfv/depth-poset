\par The probabilistic model is simple. The first we just generate the cloud of $n$ points uniformly distributed in $[0, 1]^d$. After this we calculate the Alpha complex with these points, and then find its depth poset. Then we itarate all neighbour pairs of simplices and check if their transposition will be possible filtration, calculating the scores for the switch-forward transpositions.
\par We can see the generated cloud and its simplicial complex in the Figure \ref{fig:cloud}.
